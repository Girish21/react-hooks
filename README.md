# Practical React Hooks

This is the repository for Practical React Hooks, to learn and understand custom hooks and how to use them in your React applications.

## Prerequisites

You are expected to have a basic understanding of React and JavaScript. You should be experienced with `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. To learn more about the basics of React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and the [Beta Docs of React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn).

## System Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.22 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional)

## üìù Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
3. For each exercise, run `yarn test <exercise-number>` to run the tests for that exercise. For example, to run the tests for exercise 1, run `yarn test 01-use-persist`
4. For each exercise, create a new branch to work on. For example, to work on exercise 1, create a new branch called `<name>/01-use-persist`
5. The tests for the exercise will fail. Make the tests pass by editing the `src/exercises/<exercise-number>/hook.ts` file
6. Submit a pull request when you are done with an exercise
